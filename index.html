					<h1>About me</h1>
					<p>
					Hi, I'm Fnessa, sometimes with 4 a's at the end. Unlike <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Person_of_Interest_(TV_series)">Harold Finch</a> I'm only a <i>slightly</i> private person, so I'm also comfortable telling you that my name is Mia, which is a bit easier to say than the random collection of letters that my username is made out of, but you are also welcome to use that. I am in my early 20's and queer, but I am a private enough person that I will not go into detail with those things here and now. I will also not tell you where I live, but I can tell you that I do speak German, Danish, and English.

				<p>
				Welcome to my little very WIP website :D <br> 
				I have no idea what I am doing with this, but it seems like a cool thing to do, so I am just trying this. Things will not work, that is because I have many interests, a few obligations, and only very little time, so I might sometimes just stop working on something, even though it is clearly broken. Please notify me about accessibility issues though, I will be trying my best to keep it as accessible as possible, but I have very little experience with doing this, so I might miss some things.<br>
				Nothing here (or anything I do) is made with generative AI. In fact is almost every single character in this website typed in manually, because I think that is kind of cool. Of course I am using copy paste, and I have a editor plugin that can help me a bit with for example closing html tags.
				</p>
				<p>
				I advise you against it, and I don't know why you would want to, but you can see the git repo for this website at <a href="https://github.com/Fnessa/website">https://github.com/Fnessa/website</a>
