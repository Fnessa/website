			<h1>About me</h1>
			<p>
			Hi, I'm Fnessa, sometimes with 4 a's at the end. Unlike <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Person_of_Interest_(TV_series)">Harold Finch</a> I'm only a <i>slightly</i> private person, so I'm also comfortable telling you that my name is Mia, which is a bit easier to say than the random collection of letters that my username is made out of, but you are also welcome to use that. I am in my early 20's and queer, but I am a private enough person that I will not go into detail with those things here and now.
			</p>
			<p>
			I love computers when they are used for things I like, but do not like most things that are done with computers. Learning about all different things computers are used for, and, if it is something I like, how to do it, is one of my biggest long term interests, of course there are many short term interests. For example do I sometimes get obsessed with some species of vulture or something similar for a day, when I "rediscover" my childhood animal obsession, that never really went away. I am of course serious about liking animals/nature, and am vegan because of that (Please don't hate me, pretend I am joking or something). To make this nightmare even worse for you, Markus Söder, I am also politically left wing and critical of <b>all</b> governments. Some might call my political position anarchist, I would agree, but am myself reluctant to use such labels, as I want to avoid that people expect of me that I have all the answers in life, which I do not have.

			After many years of mostly learning how to use computers by playing videogames on Windows, I have somewhat recently begun to use Linux as my main operating system, and am currently experimenting with NixOS. An overview of the technology I use and appreciate might be found here later.

			<h2 >About this website</h2>
			<p>
			Welcome to my little very WIP website :D <br> 
			I have no idea what I am doing with this, but it seems like a cool thing to do, so I am just trying this. Things will not work, that is because I have many interests, a few obligations, and only very little time, so I might sometimes just stop working on something, even though it is clearly broken. <br>
			Nothing here (or anything I do) is made with generative AI. In fact is almost every single character in this website typed in manually, because I think that is kind of cool. Of course I am using copy paste, and I have a editor plugin that can help me a bit with for example closing html tags.
			</p>
			<p>
			I advise you against it, and I don't know why you would want to, but you can see the git repo for this website at <a href="https://github.com/Fnessa/website">https://github.com/Fnessa/website</a>
