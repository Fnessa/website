			<h1>Things I like and things I do</h1>
			<p>
			I love computers when they are used for things I like, but do not like most things that are done with computers. Learning about all different things computers are used for, and, if it is something I like, how to do it, is one of my biggest long term interests, of course there are many short term interests. For example do I sometimes get obsessed with some species of vulture or something similar for a day, when I "rediscover" my childhood animal obsession, that never really went away. I am of course serious about liking animals/nature, and am vegan because of that (Please don't hate me, pretend I am joking or something). To make this nightmare even worse for you, Markus Söder, I am also politically left wing and critical of <b>all</b> governments. Some might call my political position anarchist, I would agree, but am myself reluctant to use such labels, as I want to avoid that people expect of me that I have all the answers in life, which I do not have.

			After many years of mostly learning how to use computers by playing videogames on Windows, I have somewhat recently begun to use Linux as my main operating system, and am currently experimenting with NixOS. An overview of the technology I use and appreciate might be found here later.

			I do like reading things, and, as of writing this, have begun a reread of my favourite book series, Andrzej Sapkowski's The Witcher. I have listened to them in English already, but took the release of the newest book, Crossroads of Ravens, as an occasion to read the entire series in German. I love these books, and highly recommend reading them.<br>
			Sometimes I might remember to track what I am reading at <a href="https://bookwyrm.social/user/Fnessa">Fnessa@bookwyrm.social</a>, which is also on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fediverse">Fediverse</a>!

			I also play violin! Sadly I do not have the time and energy to practice as much as I want to though. Because of my own playing I have started to love Western classical music, especially from the romantic or baroque eras. Some of my favourite pieces in no particular order are:
			<ul>
				<li>Sibelius Violin Concerto</li>
				<li>Rachmaninov Piano Concerto No. 2</li>
				<li>Tchaikovsky Symphony No. 6</li>
				<li>Wieniawski Violin Concerto No. 1</li>
				<li>Anything by J. S. Bach really, but especially the Chaconne of his Partita for Violin No. 2</li>
			</ul>
