			<h1>Things I like and things I do</h1>
			<h2>Nature</h2>
			<p>I love nature, and thanks to the hashtags #lichensubscribe and #mosstodon on mastodon I have started enjoying the small pockets of nature around me again. I have loved animals my entire life, and have been vegan because of that for a while now.</p>
			<h2>Books, Podcasts, etc.</h2>
			<p>
			When I get the time to read books for fun I sometimes remember to track what I am reading at <a href="https://bookwyrm.social/user/Fnessa">Fnessa@bookwyrm.social</a>, which is also on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fediverse">Fediverse</a>!
			</p>
			<h2>Music</h2>
			<p>
			I have been playing violin for a few years now, but sadly I do not have the time and energy to practice as much as I want to. Because of my own playing I have started to love Western classical music, especially from the romantic or baroque eras. Some of my favourite pieces in no particular order are:
			<ul>
				<li>Sibelius Violin Concerto</li>
				<li>Rachmaninov Piano Concerto No. 2</li>
				<li>Tchaikovsky Symphony No. 6</li>
				<li>Wieniawski Violin Concerto No. 1</li>
				<li>Anything by J. S. Bach really, but especially the Chaconne of his Partita for Violin No. 2</li>
			</ul>
			But I do not exclusively listen to classical music, and am able to enjoy many different genres of music, and am always looking for something new to listen to.
